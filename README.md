# Zsargul's DWMblocks

This is my custom build of DWM blocks, specifically [UtkarshVerma's dwmblocks-async](https://github.com/UtkarshVerma/dwmblocks-async) which allows for asynchronous execution of the block commands. I use it alongside
[my build of DMW](https://github.com/Zsargul/dwm). You can find the scripts that are used in these blocks [here](https://github.com/Zsargul/scripts/tree/master/statusbar-scripts).
